<div class="about-me">
    <p>
        I started my journey in technology in 2012 when I built my first gaming computer. Ever since, I’ve been
        fascinated
        by the way that hardware and software can come together to bring digital experiences to life. Fast forward to
        today,
        and I’ve had the privilege to work at several great organizations working roles from Desktop Support, to Cloud
        Engineering, to Site Reliability Engineering, and beyond.

        I’m currently working as a Data Engineer at Meijer - one of the largest private grocery stores in the country.
        Here
        I’m focused on building reliable data pipelines and integrations to bring our Retail Media Network and marketing
        platforms to the next level.

        When I’m not at the computer, you can find me picking up heavy things, exploring the beauty of West Michigan,
        and
        working to become 1% better every day.`
